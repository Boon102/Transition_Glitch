## Description
I'll be creating a thing that's somwhat similar to how digital rain is executed. I'll be attempting to make a transistion from a black screen into a scene. What im doing to make this more unique and challanging is by having a sort of glitch transistion between from the black screen into the scene that starts from the top right, that then progressively ends towards the bottom left of the screen. the line that transistion between from a black screen into the scene will be differing in terms of how much of the screen is revealed, the way the glitch is represented, and how it'll act. this relates to digital media because of how this transistion can be applied into a game: like in a cyberpunk world where the main characters turns on their cybernetic eye, transistioning from a black screen into the scene of the game

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Firstly, the transistion starts from a black screen into the scene. the transistion will start from the top right of the screen towards the bottom left of the screen.
- Feature 2
	- The line that transistions the screen will be different in length, with some of the transistions being either ahead of the line or behind the line
- Feature 3
	- lastly, the way the line will look will also be that of a glitch effect. by utalizing squares, i'll attempt to make them different sizes and colors. the squares starts off big if it's just starting from the black screen transistion, then then gets smaller as it reaches towards the scene.

## Challenges
- My main challange is to figure out how to even make a transistion in the first place, and how would i go about it 
- My second chllange is figuring out how to add the features in which the glitch is represented when transistioning from black screen into the scene. 
- Lastly, I'll also be creating the scene myself to fit the theme. i'll be attempting to create a cyberpunk scene that the black screen is transistioning into.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- My ideal outcome is to have the transistion match the scene of a cyberpunk world, with which hints that the main character has a cybernetic eye augment. my main way to hint at this is hopefully with the glitch transistion.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- I at least need to have a transistion figured out to begine with. figuring out how to transistion from a black screen will be the bare minimum. anything else such as it transistioning from the top right of the screen to then the bottom left, or the glitch effect for that matter, will be the ideal outcome.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  Hopefully figure out how to incoperate a transistion from a black screen into the scene that i desire
  Have the scene that i desire to be planned out and have a blockout of it
  
- Week 2
  Assuming i've figured out how to incorperate a transistion, my next step is figuring out how to have the transistion start from the top right of the screen to then end at the bottom left of the screen
  Hopefully have the scene to be presentable and ready 

- Week 3 (Final)
  Assuming i've managed to get everything figured out regarding a transistion and from where it starts, i'll then work on the glitch effects of the transistion
  lastly i'll be doing some final touches to the scene and then figuring out how to apply the scene to the glitch transistion
